According to the features you have and the data structure given below, determine which feature should be the target.
Then list 3 interesting questions that could be asked on this data, for instance about specific correlations with target variable.
Then answer these questions one by one, by finding the relevant numbers.
Meanwhile, plot some figures using matplotlib/seaborn and save them to the (already existing) folder './figures/': take care to clear each figure with plt.clf() before doing another plot.

In your final answer: summarize these correlations and trends
After each number derive real worlds insights, for instance: "Correlation between is_december and boredness is 1.3453, which suggest people are more bored in winter".
Your final answer should be a long string with at least 3 numbered and detailed parts.

Structure of the data:
{structure_notes}

The data file is passed to you as the variable data_file, it is a pandas dataframe, you can use it directly.
DO NOT try to load data_file, it is already a dataframe pre-loaded in your python interpreter!
